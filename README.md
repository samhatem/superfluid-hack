# superfluid-hack

https://sub-demo-ui.herokuapp.com

A subscription protocol on superfluid that rewards active social token holders. Subscribers can subscribe to content for exactly as long as they want--they're free to cancel at any time. The subscription is streamed in the creator's social token which is then pooled in our SuperApp smart contract. Holders of the creator's social token can they register to be rewarded, and the social tokens held in the contract and distributed to them whenever the creator wants.

Future iterations will fix current bugs with distributing tokens. It will also integrate uniswap so people can buy the token seemlessly right on our site.
